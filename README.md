## Projects
### XAI Flood mapping
Segmentation of Flood water on remote sensed Sentinel-1 images with gradient based visual explanations to enhance interpretability
### Flood Informatics
Designed and implemented an end-to-end real time flood level and scene object detection
pipeline where I streamed and annotated social media images and NOAA weather data. Frameworks used were
Pytorch 1.8, Tensorflow Core API and object detection API
### Dynamic River basin Streamflow time series prediction 
Developed web API with hybrid recurrent neural network using Keras, JS. 
### Rainfall-runoﬀ modeling pipeline 
historical and ongoing river runoff data was collected by me from US and Global watersheds with ArcPy over one year
### Explainable NLP
Natural language based explanation generation for text classification models. Frameworks used were Keras API, LIME
### Defense on Robust Physical Attack against road sign classifier of self driving vehicles
Implemented novel defense strategies such as retrieval of clean images from adversarial perturbed ones using Deep Siamese
Network and graﬃti detection on perturbed images with U-Network using Tensorflow core and Keras API
### Review spam detection and opinion mining
Anomaly Detection and Opinion Mining on Amazon,Yelp Reviews with Hierarchical Attention model and support vector machine using Keras API
### Python Interpreter
I built python 2.7 Interpreter with C++11,Flex,Bison
